# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sept 14, 2017 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Implemented saving of  images into android private directory, learned about Android Storage access framework, worked on functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled on how to store gallery image's Uri or absolute path in Sqlite db so I can use that Uri to show image anytime but I was always getting an exception of having permission of MANAGE_DOCUMENTS then I learned about new Android storage Access Framework for API>19. So now I am creating my own copy of that image in the app private directory in this way I can use that image anytime by storing its new path
