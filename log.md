# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sept 14, 2017 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Implemented saving of  images into android private directory, learned about Android Storage access framework, worked on functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled on how to store gallery image's Uri or absolute path in Sqlite db so I can use that Uri to show image anytime but I was always getting an exception of having permission of MANAGE_DOCUMENTS then I learned about new Android storage Access Framework for API>19. So now I am creating my own copy of that image in the app private directory in this way I can use that image anytime by storing its new path

### Day 2: Sept 16, 2017 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Read the book Kotlin for Android Developers by Antonio Leiva. Right now I am at chapter 7. Implemented Anko(kotlin library) and kotlin extension functions. Fixed the issue for showing all saved notes in my text editor app by using nested select and group queries in Android Room. Fixed minor bugs in the android app like adding of images as bitmap from database

**Thoughts:** I love the Android architecture components. Till now I have played with Room. Its speeds up the development process like by 100 times by auto generating mapping code of cusor and Data class. Knowing sql queries really makes your life easier as. I have just started with Anko library and till now I love it. In kotlin I read about how to use extension functions and how it helps to reduce your boilerplate code .I still have long way to go in kotlin.
